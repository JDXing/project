                ST. LITTLE FLOWER (Patron Saint of the School)
            </h2>
            <p>St. Little Flower, also known as St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus, is the heavenly patron of our school.
                She was a young Carmelite nun who lived a life of deep simplicity, humility, and love for God.</p>
            <p>St. Thérèse is known for her “Little Way” - finding holiness in small acts of kindness, love, and
                sacrifice done with a pure heart. Her life reminds us that greatness is achieved not by doing
                extraordinary things, but by doing ordinary things with extraordinary love.</p>
            <p>As the patron of our school, St. Little Flower inspires every child to grow with a pure heart, live
                joyfully, and spread love and service to all. We believe her blessings guide our students to become
                gentle, compassionate, and value-filled human beings.</p>
