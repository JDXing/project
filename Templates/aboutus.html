            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                The School was founded in 1975 with a vision to provide quality education 
                to students in our community. What started as a small institution with just 
                50 students and 5 teachers has now grown into one of the most respected 
                schools in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the decades, the school has expanded its facilities, introducing 
                modern classrooms, science and computer labs, and a library that supports 
                both academic and extracurricular excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our alumni have gone on to excel in diverse fields including medicine, 
                engineering, arts, business, and public service, carrying forward the 
                schoolâ€™s legacy of leadership and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, The School continues its mission of nurturing young minds, 
                focusing on holistic development, moral values, and academic success.
